# `osdmain.elf`

Generic System update KELF path.

Every console with BOOT-ROM starting with `1.50` will prioritize this KELF instead of the specific ROM patch

BOOT-ROM `1.50` was implemented on the late `SCPH-30XXX` units, meaning that this file will cover a HUGE amount of consoles (every slim and every FAT made after the late 30k series)
