# Menu Options
## main menu
- Install - Performs a normal installation of FMCB. Offers three modes:
  - Normal - install  FMCB for the PS2.
  - Cross-model - Install FMCB for all models within the region of the PS2.
  - Cross-region - Install FMCB for all PS2s, across all regions.
- Multi-Install - Performs a traditional "multi" installation of FMCB. A multi-installation can boot on all consoles of any region, and not only on the console it was installed with. __However, this method is not recommended because it involves corrupting the memory card.__
- Uninstall FMCB - Removes a normal installation of FMCB from a memory card.
- Uninstall MI - Uninstalls a multi-installation, turning it back into a normal FMCB installation.
- Exit - Exits the installer and returns back to the OSDSYS menu.
