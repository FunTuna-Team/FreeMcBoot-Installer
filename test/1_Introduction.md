# Introduction

This is an Free Memory Card Boot (FMCB) installer. It was previously known as the "Unofficial FMCB v1.8C" installer. 

No part of it was directly re-used from FMCB v1.7 itself, but parts of it were based or referenced from the code of FMCB v1.7. 

Since FMCB v1.9 was born, this new FMCB installer has been used for installing FMCB and itÂ´s variants.
